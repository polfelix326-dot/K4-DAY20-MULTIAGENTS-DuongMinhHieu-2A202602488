description: Use this skill when fixing bugs or modifying existing packages to ensure tests are not modified, regression tests are added correctly, type hints are complete, and changelog entries are properly recorded.

## Code Modification & Compliance Checklist
1. **Never Modify Existing Tests**: Do not edit files in the `tests/` directory. Create new test files (e.g., `tests/test_regressions.py`) for new tests.
2. **Type Annotations**: Ensure every public function (any function whose name does not start with an underscore) has full type annotations on all parameters and the return value.
3. **Regression Tests**: Add a dedicated test file with at least one test function per fixed bug, ensuring all tests pass successfully.
4. **Changelog Updates**: Record each fix in `CHANGELOG.md` under the `## Unreleased` heading using the required bullet format: `- fix(<function name>): <short description>`.
