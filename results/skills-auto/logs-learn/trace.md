### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/app.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-01T03:04:05Z", "service": "payment-service", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "Charge failed order=991", "exception": "ValueError: invalid card number", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"payment-service": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR or CRITICAL (any capitalisation). Do not include WARN/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG entries.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after `<service>: ` on the first line of the entry.
- `exception` is the last line of the traceback attached to the entry, or `null` if the entry has no traceback.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

## Code Modification & Compliance Checklist
1. **Never Modify Existing Tests**: Do not edit files in the `tests/` directory. Create new test files (e.g., `tests/test_regressions.py`) for new tests.
2. **Type Annotations**: Ensure every public function (any function whose name does not start with an underscore) has full type annotations on all parameters and the return value.
3. **Regression Tests**: Add a dedicated test file with at least one test function per fixed bug, ensuring all tests pass successfully.
4. **Changelog Updates**: Record each fix in `CHANGELOG.md` under the `## Unreleased` heading using the required bullet format: `- fix(<function name>): <short description>`.

## Schema & Output Formatting Checklist
1. **Review All Rules First**: Before writing output files (`json`, `csv`, etc.), list all formatting rules from the prompt/instructions.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Check if keys, enum values, or identifiers require specific transformations (e.g., replacing hyphens with underscores, lower-casing, or canonical capitalization).
3. **Data Types & Units**:
   - Ensure monetary values are stored in the requested format (e.g., integer cents instead of floats).
   - Ensure timestamps adhere strictly to the requested format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` in UTC).
4. **Metadata & Schema Headers**: Include all required metadata blocks (e.g., row counts, source filenames, schema version integers) at the top level of output objects.
5. **Validation**: Write a small script to validate the output file against every rule before completing the task.

# app.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    <timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>

- `timestamp` is ISO-8601 with a UTC offset (`+07:00`, `-05:00` or `Z`).
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- An entry can be followed by extra lines (for example a Python traceback). Those lines belong to the entry above them.
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.
